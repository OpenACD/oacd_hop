Overview
========

A plugin to take the cdr and agent state information generated by OpenACD 
and publish in as protobufs in RabbitMQ.  This is meant to decouple OpenACD
from archiving and real-time reporting endpoints.

Building
========

    ./rebar get-deps compile

This will get required dependancies and package only what is absolutly 
needed for the plugin in './plugin'.

Installing
==========

Copy the contents of the created './plugin' directory into OpenACD's plugins
directory.  Then in OpenACD's shell:

    cpx:load_plugins(oacd_hop).
